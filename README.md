# Linear Regression Workshop at IIT-Bombay 
This is the code for the "How to Do Linear Regression" workshop session by Jalaj Thanaki at IIT-Bombay.


## Overview

* Find the dataset from [here](https://github.com/jalajthanaki/Linear-Regression-Workshop/blob/master/data/data.csv) 
* Find the Code in form of Jupyter Notebook from [here](https://github.com/jalajthanaki/Linear-Regression-Workshop/blob/master/Linear%20Regression%20Demo.ipynb)
* Find the images from [here](https://github.com/jalajthanaki/Linear-Regression-Workshop/tree/master/image).

## Data 
I'm using a very small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied. 
Intuitively, we know that there must be a relationship right? The more you study, the better your test scores should be. 
We're going to use linear regression to prove this relationship.

## Dependencies
We need two dependencies

1. numpy
2. Jupyter Notebook

#### Installation of dependencies
* numpy

    ```    
    For Pythton 2
      $ pip install numpy 
    For Python 3  
      $ pip3 install numpy
    
    ```  
      
* Jupyter Notebook
 
    ```
    For Pythton 2
        $ pip install jupyter
    For Python 3  
        $ pip3 install jupyter
        
    ```  

Python 2 and 3 both work for this. Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install any dependencies.

## Usage

I have used Python 2 but if you want to use Python 3 then just choose Python3 when you will run code on Jupyter Notebook. 
As well as change syntax of print command.
